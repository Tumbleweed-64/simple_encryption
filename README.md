# simple_encryption

This is a collection of some fun codes and ciphers that you most likely know, built in C++ and C#.

# Why?

You can like, send cool secret messages to your friends if that's what you do. I don't know.

# Cool, which ciphers?

So far I've made...

- Morse encoder
- Caesar Shift
- Substitution cipher maker

More coming soon. I think the caesar shift decryption method will be pretty easy, as you essentially just brute-force it.
Pull request for different ciphers. The Atbash and Keyword ciphers are coming next.

# 2024 UPDATE

I've decided to come back to this. I will be rewriting all the programs in C++, and I will add Linux executable versions. The main reason I'm getting rid of the C# versions is that it's really annoying to install the dotnet suite on Ubuntu. Anyway, enjoy the ones that are here for now, I'm working on some new ones.

Anyway, check this out, and as I said, pull request if you want different ciphers.
